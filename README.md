This repository covers the work of several scientific papers in the field of blendshape animation of the human face, that together build my PhD thesis, titled "...".

## LMMM - Levenbergâ€“Marquardt Majorization-Minimization-based Solution

THis chapter consists of two papers, solving the inverse rig problem on a base of Majorization-Minimization, in order to simplyfy originally complex, nonconvex objective. the corresponing scripts can be found in ../Scripts/LMMM repo.

#### A Majorization--Minimization-Based Method for Nonconvex Inverse Rig Problems in Facial Animation: Algorithm Derivation

https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11590-023-02012-w

This paper gives a mathematical derivation of the algorithm, with convergence guarantees.

#### Accurate and Interpretable Solution of the Inverse Rig for Realistic Blendshape Models with Quadratic Corrective Terms

https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04843

Complementing the previous paper, this one quantitativelly explores the results and benchmarks the algoritm with SOTA approaches over animated sequences.

## Distributed Solution 

This chapter includes two papers, and corresponding scripts are in ../Scripts/DistributedSolution repo.

 #### Clustering of the Blendshape Facial Model
 
 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9616061

 This paper clusters the blendashape face into a semantically meaningful segments, allowing for a distributed approach to solving the inverse rig problem.

#### Distributed Solution of the Blendshape Rig Inversion Problem

https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3610543.3626166

This is a further developement of the above paper, that incorporates the ADMM paradigm to improve the estimates of the overlapping segment components.
