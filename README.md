This repository covers the work of several scientific papers in the field of blendshape animation of the human face, that together build my PhD thesis, titled "...".

## Distributed Solution 

This chapter includes two papers, and corresponding scripts are in ../Scripts/DistributedSolution repo.

 #### Clustering of the Blendshape Facial Model
 
 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9616061

 This paper clusters the blendashape face into a semantically meaningful segments, allowing for a distributed approach to solving the inverse rig problem.

#### Distributed Solution of the Blendshape Rig Inversion Problem

https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3610543.3626166

This is a further developement of the above paper, that incorporates the ADMM paradigm to improve the estimates of the overlapping segment components.
